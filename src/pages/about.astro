  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p><strong>Software Engineer. Storyteller. Explorer.</strong></p>

  <p>
    I'm Steve Hill, a senior software engineer based in the UK. I've been writing code professionally for over 15 years, but my interest in how things work goes back much further—back to the days of rubber keys, cassette tapes, and typing out BASIC listings from magazines.
  </p>

  <p>
    These days, I work across full-stack web development and infrastructure, with a particular focus on Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes. I've led projects that modernise legacy systems, improve CI/CD pipelines, introduce infrastructure-as-code, and guide teams through major upgrades. I've worked in scaling SaaS companies like 
    <a href="https://www.resourceguruapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource Guru</a>, as well as in smaller teams where I've worn many hats—developer, architect, problem-solver, occasional firefighter.
  </p>

  <p>
    I care about clean code, clear thinking, and meaningful outcomes. I believe that understanding <em>why</em> we build is just as important as <em>how</em> we build. That belief has shaped the way I work and the kind of problems I like to solve.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of client work, I run <a href="https://code198x.stevehill.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code Like It's 198x</a>, a long-term project exploring retro computers like the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and BBC Micro. It's part curriculum, part toolkit, part time machine—bringing modern tooling like Docker and Makefiles to classic 8-bit and early 16-bit platforms. It's an excuse to understand old systems deeply, and to teach others along the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll find all of that—and more—reflected across this site. Expect blog posts about engineering and architecture, technical deep dives, occasional rants, and a fair bit of nostalgia. If you're into thoughtful software, honest documentation, or seeing what yesterday's machines can teach today's developers, you'll probably feel at home here.
