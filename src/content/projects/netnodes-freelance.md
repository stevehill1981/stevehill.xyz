# NetNodes Platform Development

**Role**: Freelance Full-Stack Developer & Infrastructure Lead  
**Client**: NetNodes (Access Control Technology)  
**Duration**: Ongoing (2024+)

## Project Overview

Leading development on a comprehensive access control platform consisting of 15+ interconnected services. The system provides enterprise-grade access management with hardware device integration, serving organizations requiring secure facility access control.

## Technical Architecture

**Core Platform**
- **Multi-service Ruby on Rails ecosystem** (Rails 8.0.2) with modern asset pipeline
- **Python-based device integration** services for hardware synchronization
- **TimescaleDB** for time-series event data and analytics
- **Redis** for inter-service communication and background job processing
- **Multi-tenant architecture** supporting enterprise organizations

**Infrastructure & DevOps**
- **Kubernetes** deployment with containerized services
- **Ansible** automation for infrastructure management and deployments
- **GitHub Actions** CI/CD pipelines
- **Comprehensive testing** across unit, integration, and system levels

## Major Infrastructure Initiatives

**Legacy to Modern Infrastructure Migration**
- **Led migration from legacy servers to Docker containers** across all 15+ services
- **Orchestrated containerization strategy** ensuring zero-downtime deployment
- **Designed and implemented Kubernetes migration** from Docker containers
- **Planned and executed complex PostgreSQL 11 → PostgreSQL 17 upgrade** including TimescaleDB extension migration

**Infrastructure as Code**
- **Authored comprehensive Ansible playbooks** for automated deployment and configuration management
- **Implemented infrastructure automation** covering service installation, updates, and monitoring setup
- **Designed deployment pipelines** integrating Kubernetes with GitHub Actions

## Key Responsibilities

**Full-Stack Development**
- Design and implement new features across multiple Rails applications
- Build RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specifications
- Develop responsive front-end interfaces using modern Rails tooling

**Infrastructure Leadership**
- Plan and execute major infrastructure migrations with minimal downtime
- Design containerization and orchestration strategies
- Implement database migration strategies for production systems

**System Architecture**
- Design service communication patterns and data flows
- Implement background processing systems with Sidekiq
- Optimize database performance and query efficiency

**DevOps & Automation**
- Maintain and extend Ansible automation for 15+ services
- Configure Kubernetes manifests and service orchestration
- Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting solutions

**Integration & APIs**
- Generate and maintain client SDKs in multiple languages
- Design API integrations for third-party services
- Implement authentication and authorization systems

## Technical Challenges

- **Zero-Downtime Migrations**: Successfully migrating production systems from legacy infrastructure to modern containerized platform
- **Complex Database Upgrades**: PostgreSQL 11→17 upgrade path with TimescaleDB extension compatibility
- **Service Orchestration**: Coordinating deployments across 15+ interconnected services
- **Enterprise Requirements**: SAML/LDAP integration, compliance, and scalability
- **Multi-tenant Data Isolation**: Ensuring secure separation of organizational data

## Impact

Successfully modernized a complex enterprise platform, transitioning from legacy infrastructure to a fully containerized, orchestrated system. The migrations improved system reliability, deployment speed, and maintenance overhead while maintaining zero downtime for production services.

*This work demonstrates expertise in infrastructure modernization, complex database migrations, container orchestration, and enterprise-level system architecture.*
